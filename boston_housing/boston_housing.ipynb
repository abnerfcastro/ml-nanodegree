A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",

    "An increase in `RM` would lead to an **increase** in `MEDV`, because the number of rooms in a house is directly proportional to its size; therefore, a house containing more rooms would be larger and cost more.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a neighborhood that has an increased `LSTAT` value *tends to* be associated with higher crime rates, hence its `MEDV` would be considerably lower.\n",

    "Lastly, a higher `PTRATIO` means a neighborhood has more teachers available, which could potentially indicate that there are more schools nearby, an inference that brings more appeal to a neighborhood and raises real estate prices. Thus, `MEDV` and `PTRATIO` are directly proportional as well."

When the model is trained, it tries its best to find out a pattern in the training dataset while minimizing the error rate.

Additionally, if the model fails to find patterns, it **underfits** the data and will not predict well.\n",

    "Chosen graph has `max_depth=6`. The **Training Score** slightly decreases and converges to around `0.8` as the number of points increases. As for the **Testing Score** we see a sudden increase for the `0-50` number of points range, another slight increase ranging `50-150` and then stabilizes and converges to score `0.6`. Therefore, the sweet spot for `max_depth=6` lies at 150 Training Points, where we have the maximum Testing Score without compromising the Training Score so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis of the curves, it is safe to conclude that the model has **slightly overfitted the data (High Variance scenario)** ― but not as much as `max_depth=10` though, meaning the gap between the curves as they converge is larger than aimed for."

    "### Complexity Curves\n",
    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "**Run the code cell below and use this graph to answer the following two questions Q5 and Q6.**"

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "With a maximum depth of 1, the model suffers from high bias, meaning it is underfitting and oversimplified. The visual cue is a low score of both **Training** and **Validation** sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the maximum depth of 10, the model suffers from high variance or overfitting. The visual cues are the great gap between **Training** and **Validation** scores, as well as a high score for the **Training** set in contrast to a much lower score for the **Validation** set. This means that the model memorized the data and overfit it, but performs badly with a testing/validation sets."

    "* Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data? \n",

    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "#### Answer:\n",
    "A maximum depth of 3 best generalizes the unseen data because the Training and Validation score curves are tightly close together, locked at a score ranging from `0.7` to `0.8`, give or take. The curves for maximum depth of 2 are even closer, but at 3 the scores are slightly higher, which is a fair trade-off."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, Grid Search is a technique to find the optimal combination of parameters for a given model. This optimization usually aims to minimize the training error of a model ― let's call it $M$ ― that takes the training sample $S_{train}$ and additional parameters, say $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ (also known as _hyperparemeters_).\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal is to find values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that tune the model for a minimal training error. As for most optimization problems, finding the perfect fit is notably expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we resort to **Grid Search**, which is achieved by preselecting a finite set of values of $\\alpha$ $(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ...)$ and $\\beta$ $(\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ...)$ and solving the optimization problem for each permutation pair of values $(\\alpha_1, \\beta_1), (\\alpha_2, \\beta_1), ..., (\\alpha_2, \\beta_1), (\\alpha_2, \\beta_2), ...$ that, when plotted in space, look like a grid ― hence the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Decision Tree Classifier model, `max_depth` is an example of parameter that can be optmized using Grid Search."

    "\n",
    "The golden rule of Machine Learning dictates that _testing data should never be used for training a model_. Yet, deciding on a befitting model implicates in evaluating each candidate model before making a final judgment. That's where Cross-Validation comes in to play.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, Cross-Validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate a machine learning model on a limited data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-fold technique is one variant of Cross Validation which involves randomly dividing the original sample into $k$ groups, or folds, of approximately equal size. The first fold is treated as a validation set, and the method is fit on the remaining $k − 1$ folds. This process is then repeated $k$ times, with each of the $k$ subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The $k$ results can then be averaged to produce a single estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a fairly popular method because it generally results in a less biased estimate of the model skill than other methods, such as a simple train/test split; this helps preventing overfitting and is certainly beneficial to Grid Search when optimizing a model.\n",

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n",
    "  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n",

    "#### Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "**How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978? How important is inflation?**<br>\n",
    "Inflation measures the buying power of a particular currency over time. This [Inflation Calculator](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com) shows that an item costing 1 dollar in 1978 would cost roughly 3.85 dollars in 2018. That is a **285.1%** increase! It doesn't necessarily mean, however, that every asset priced in 1978 should cost 285.1% more in 2018. It simply serves as a takeaway that prices do increase over time and inflation must be accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographics also changes a lot over the course of 40 years. For example, population growth and government policies may certainly have an effect on poverty level as well as student-teacher ratio; but at the same time new schools could have been built as well. All of these, combined with inflation and other pertinent factors, exert profound influence on housing market prices. Therefore, data collected from 1978 might not be so relevant today.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home? Do you think factors like quality of appliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or not etc should factor in?**<br>\n",
    "The features present in the data are unquestionably relevant, but not sufficient. Factors like property maintenance, local amenities nearby ― such as hospitals, parks, grocery stores, shopping malls and public transport access; distance to downtown district, crime rates, air and noise pollution levels etc should all factor in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?**<br>\n",
    "Yes, to an extent. The model is constrained by the lack of additional relevant factors that should weigh in when estimating the selling price of houses accurately. These additional factors could help explain the deviations that section [Question 10 - Predicting Selling Prices](#predicting-selling-prices) answer touched upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?**<br>\n",
    "No, it may not be applicable due to demographics differences between urban and rural cities. A model for a rural city may take into consideration factors that wouldn't otherwise be so relevant to an urban model. For an instance, the distance to nearest urban center or metropole city would probably be deemed pertinent for predicting rural house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is it fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of the entire neighborhood?**<br>\n",
    "Yes, it definitely is. Let's consider two identical houses built on two distinct neighborhoods A and B. Neighborhood A holds the lowest crime rates in the city and is situated near parks, health centers, police and fire departments. On the other hand, Neighborhood B is situated on the outskirts of the city and holds not alarming but slightly higher crime rates. Even though the houses look exactly the same down to every detail, their vicinity may be extremely different, which may lead to a huge impact in an individual's quality of life. _Law of Supply and Demand_ endorses that there would be more potential buyers (i.e _demand_) willing to buy houses on Neighborhood A. That alone is sufficient to increase house prices on Neighborhood A in contrast to Neighborhood B."
